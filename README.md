## Project Overview

This project is a frontend demo for a casino and sports betting platform, inspired by a licensed online gambling service operating since 2017. It showcases a variety of casino games (slots, table games, live casino), sports betting options (covering 50+ sports and eSports), and promotional offers. The platform supports multiple languages and currencies, including cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. Built with MUI and Next.js, this demo focuses on delivering a visually appealing, responsive UI with static data, ideal for developers exploring MUI’s capabilities in building gambling platform interfaces.

- **Material-UI (MUI)**: Component library for responsive, modern design.
- **Next.js**: Framework for static site generation or server-side rendering (assumed based on Vercel deployment).
- **JavaScript/TypeScript**: Programming language for frontend logic.
- **Vercel**: Hosting platform for deployment.
- **CSS**: Styling with MUI’s system and custom styles.
- **JSON**: Static data for games, sports, promotions, and leaderboard.

## Installation

To set up the project locally:

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/mui-test-project.git
   cd mui-test-project
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   Ensure [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v16 or higher) is installed, then run:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Environment Setup**:
   No environment variables are needed for this demo, as it uses static data. For API integration, create a `.env.local` file with relevant variables (e.g., API endpoints).

4. **Run Development Server**:
   Start the Next.js server:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   Access the app at `http://localhost:3000`.

5. **Build for Production**:
   Create an optimized build:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   npm run start
